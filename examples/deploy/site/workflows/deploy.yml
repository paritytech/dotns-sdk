# Deploy a static site to a DotNS base domain on every push to main.
#
# This is the simplest deployment pattern: build the site, upload to Bulletin,
# register the domain if needed, and set the contenthash. The site is then
# accessible at https://my-app.paseo.li (or via any compatible gateway).
#
# Use case: Personal site, docs site, or any project with a single deployable.
