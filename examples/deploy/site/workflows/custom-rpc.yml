# Deploy to a local or self-hosted chain for integration testing.
#
# Uses a dev key URI (//Alice) instead of a mnemonic, and overrides both the
# Bulletin RPC and registry RPC to point at local endpoints. Useful for CI
# pipelines that spin up a local Substrate chain as a service container.
#
# The skip-cache flag is set to true because local chains reset between runs,
# so cached CIDs from a previous chain state would be invalid.
#
# Use case: Integration tests that verify end-to-end deployment against a
# local chain before promoting to testnet.
