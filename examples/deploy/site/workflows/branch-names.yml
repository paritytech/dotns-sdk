# Deploy feature branch previews using the branch name as the subname.
#
# Instead of pr42.my-app.dot, this creates feature-auth.my-app.dot which maybe
# easier to remember and share. Branch names are sanitised automatically
# (lowercased, special chars replaced with hyphens, truncated to 20 chars).
#
# The workflow also demonstrates manual dispatch with a skip-cache option,
# useful for forcing a re-upload when debugging gateway propagation issues.
#
# Use case: Teams that prefer stable, human-readable preview URLs tied to
# feature branches rather than ephemeral PR numbers.
